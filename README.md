Adds a Website Field to Advanced Custom Fields. Select if link should be an external link, if it should show title or the url.

== Description ==

This is an add-on for the [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/)
WordPress plugin and will not provide any functionality to WordPress unless Advanced Custom Fields is installed
and activated.

The Website field gives a few basic options:
-Show / Hide Title (if checked to No, than the website URL will show on the front end and the title field will not be shown in the admin)
-Open in Current Window - default will make all URLs open a new browser window for external sites. ( if checked to Yes, than the admin section will have a checkbox to specify if the link should open the current window.)
